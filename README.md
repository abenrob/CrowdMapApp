CrowdMapApp is a crowd-sourced mapping application that allows for the collection of points and attributes.

This project is designed to deploy via [Backlift] (https://www.backlift.com/).

You will need a backlift account and a dropbox account. Both of these are available without charge (for now.) 

Clicking the link below will build this repo into a clean, functioning app within your backlift account domain - and the code will live in your dropbox.

[Copy this repo](https://www.backlift.com/backlift/dropbox/create?template=github.com/abenrob/CrowdMapApp&appname=CrowdMapApp "Copy") into your backlift.

The current build sets the available attributes for the points, and has hard-coded 'dummy text' for most components. 
The roadmap aims to create an admin panel that allows for the customization of the application by a non-developer. (Title, overview modal, point marker colors and icons, point attributes, etc.)
