# compile: Backlift will select an appropriate compiler for each file 
# that matches one of the patterns below. The file types that backlift 
# recognizes are:
#   *.jst        -> underscore templates (outputs .js files)
#   *.handlebars -> handlebars templates (outputs .js files)
#   *.less       -> lessc css compiler (outputs .css files)
#   *.coffee     -> coffeescript compiler (outputs .js files)
#
# Uncomment this block to customize which files will be compiled:

# compile:
# - public/**/*.jst
# - public/**/*.handlebars
# - public/**/bootstrap*.less
# - public/**/*.coffee


# scripts: These javascript files will be packaged and linked in 
# order. File paths should be specified relative to the project root.
# They should not be compressed. The * will match any string and **
# will match any folder.

# optimize: The optimize flag controls whether or not backlift 
# concatenates and minifies .js and .css files. The optimizer is slow
# and produces obfuscated code that cannot be easily debugged. For 
# these reasons, optimization should be disabled during development

optimize: no


# includes: Files and folders to be included when app is installed.
# Each key is a folder name, and each value is a github repository
# or gist. Github repos may specify a tag or branch via a tree url.
